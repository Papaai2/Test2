and create folders for organizing
and create a full implementation

---------------------------
Create a fully implemented modern HR Portal system using only HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. Do not use any external libraries or frameworks.

The portal must support:

Responsive and mobile-optimized design with modern UI/UX.

Dashboard showing:

A leave calendar view for the logged-in user.

The userâ€™s annual leave credit balance.

Leave Management Module:

Employees can create leave requests.

The assigned direct manager must review and approve/reject the leave.

After manager approval, the HR manager must also approve/reject it.

All leave requests must be visible to HR managers from the moment they're created.

Attendance Tracking:

Store daily clock-in and clock-out.

Allow integration with FingerTec fingerprint attendance machines (assume cloud server support for later integration, for now just prepare endpoints and logic).

Notification System:

Notify users about approvals, rejections, attendance alerts, etc.

Roles and Permissions:

Support these roles: admin, hr_manager, manager, hr_staff, employee.

Access control must be enforced on both frontend (menu visibility) and backend (action restrictions).

Payroll Management:

Calculate monthly salary including leave deductions and attendance records.

Admin and HR Manager can generate payslips.

User Management:

Admin can add, edit, and delete users.

Assign roles and departments.

Department Management:

CRUD operations for departments.

Additional Requirements:

Create a MySQL database schema (hr_portal.sql) with appropriate foreign keys and indexes.

Organize files into folders (e.g., auth, dashboard, attendance, etc.).

Use only PHP (procedural or OOP allowed) for backend.

Include session management, login system, and secure password storage (hashing).

Compatible with XAMPP on localhost, but prepare the structure for later cloud deployment.

No framework or template engine should be used. Keep it simple, raw, and maintainable.

Implement all core functionalities and provide sample data for testing.
